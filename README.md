## About Me

Hello! I'm Eric, a Computer Science student from the University of Sydney. With a passion for technology and innovation, I've dedicated my academic years to mastering the intricacies of computer science and its various applications. As I look forward to graduating in November 2023, I've curated this personal website to showcase my journey, achievements, and side projects.

## Projects

Throughout my academic and personal journey, I've been fortunate to work on a range of projects, from small scripts to comprehensive applications. This website offers a glimpse into some of those endeavors. I invite you to explore and provide feedback!
